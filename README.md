Ordering Service API – Database PostgreSQL:
`POST http://localhost:6002/order/` : takes from the shopping cart the array of json object (in the body), goes through it and adds to the postgres database time, ID of user, array of integers of all the IDs of ordered items and the total cost (which is calculated by going through the json object array) 

`GET http://localhost:6002/order/user` : has the ID of the user in the header and returns all the orders he had made (fetches it from the DB)

Shopping Cart API - Redis: 
`POST http://localhost:6000/shoppingCart` : Add JSON object to the array of json objects, it has the user id in the header "user" and the body would look like: {"name":"Antho's special burger", "price" : 43}
